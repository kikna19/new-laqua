        <h2>french angel fish</h2>
        <p>this fish lives primarily in the reefs around the Caribbean seas,
          which is awesome because it means we get to see it here as well.
          It lives in t rocks and reefs around here, and can frequently be found in the abandoned shipwrecks.
          It’s a great fish to spot on a deep sea dive and it’s easy to spot with its distinctive blue head
          and yellow spots all over its body.</p>

        <h2>blueface angel fish</h2>
        <p>in the species of angelfish, there are many that would qualify to be on this list, but the blueface
          angelfish deserves its place here. It’s a particular fish that has a dizzying pattern on its side that
          swirls and blends together in peculiar way. The head also features a bright eye spot that distinguishes
          it from among other angelfish. Although it is normally found on the other side
          of the world, there have been a few sighting in the reefs and wrecks of the Floridian coast..</p>

        <h2>trigger fish</h2>
        <p>this name actually encapsulates the 40 different species of closely related fish that all bear some
          resemblance.
          They come in bright colors and even in stark greys and whites. They can be great as a solitary tank fish,
          but they
          don’t work well in large tanks with many fish.
          They can be notoriously ill-tempered. They have the remarkable ability among fishes to learn from previous
          experiences.</p>

        <h2>clown fish</h2>
        <p>how could any list of beautiful fish be complete without the clownfish present? Because of the movie
          Finding Nemo,
          it’s become such a hot commodity that it’s getting harder and harder to find in fish stores. In the wild,
          they are
          quite numerous anywhere that anemone grows.
          They partner with the anemone to provide nutrients to the plant while the plant cleans the fish from harmful
          bacteria.</p>

        <h2>mandarin fish</h2>
        <p>the most colorful fish in the world is the mandarinfish. It’s a brightly lit, multi-colored fish that is
          remarkable to see in the wild. Anybody would count it a lucky day to spot one of
          these beauties. The name actually comes from the brightly-colored robes an Imperial Mandarin would wear.</p>
